This project focuses on leveraging Power BI and SQL to extract actionable insights from insurance data, helping organizations optimize decision-making and improve operational efficiency. By analyzing patterns in insurance claims, customer demographics, and policy trends, the project enables stakeholders to identify key opportunities, risks, and areas for improvement.

Key Features

Data Preparation & Cleaning:
Raw insurance datasets were cleaned and structured using SQL Server and MySQL. This involved handling missing values, normalizing data, and performing complex joins to create a comprehensive dataset suitable for analysis.

Interactive Dashboards:
Developed Power BI dashboards to visualize trends in insurance claims, premium collections, and customer segmentation. Users can filter data dynamically by policy type, region, and time period for granular insights.

Insights & Analysis:

Identified high-risk policyholders and potential claim fraud through trend analysis.

Monitored claim settlement times to optimize workflow efficiency.

Analyzed customer retention and churn rates to support targeted marketing campaigns.

Reporting & Decision Support:
Dashboards and reports were designed to support both strategic and operational decisions, making it easier for management to act on data-driven insights and improve overall profitability.
